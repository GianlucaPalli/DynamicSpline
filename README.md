# DynamicSpline
Matlab simulation code for dynamic splines.

The DLO library files are in the lib/ folder.

The sim/ folder contains Simulink model for Matlab 2019b and 2018b and Matlab scripts for simulation.
- model_parameters contatins the DLO model parameters, launch it first
- spline-sim.slx simulink DLO simulation
- video_generator_for_samplepoints launchs the simulation and generate a video
- matlab_simulation launch the matlab simulation
